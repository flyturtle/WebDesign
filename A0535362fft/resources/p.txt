Open World
Exploration
In the open world of Wild Hunt, you chart your own path to adventure. You play as a bounty hunter, a man of the road. You set your own goals and choose your own destinations. Go after the bounty on the head of a nasty monster pestering a village or help a scheming prince who needs a dirty job done -- no matter what style of epic questing you crave, The Witcher will provide it.
Activities
Horse races, tavern brawls, card games -- the inhabitants of the world of The Witcher know how to have a good time. Take a break from monster hunting just to join in the fun or to win some coin to further your goals. In a new twist to evenings by the fire, try your hand at gwent, a deep and rewarding game-within-a-game. Invented by dwarves and played for fun or money, this simple yet addictive pastime will have you sitting down for match after match and constantly thinking about how to bolster your deck.
story
In a war-torn world, with the Wild Hunt on your back, youâ€™ll take on your most important contract -- to track down the child of prophecy, a key and a weapon which can save or destroy all.

Monster Hunter
Witchers are mutants, men subjected to gruelling training and flesh-altering experiments that prepare them for one purpose: to kill monsters. Geralt was forged at the elite School of the Wolf and is considered one of the deadliest witchers ever trained. He possesses superhuman reflexes and strength, and his sword fighting skills are second to none.
